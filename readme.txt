== Description ==

The CiviCRM WordPress Mail Sync plugin creates WordPress posts from CiviCRM Mailings for viewing email in browser. Regular users will only have access to the mailings that they have (or should have) received.

This plugin has been developed using *WordPress 3.9* and *CiviCRM 4.4.5*. It requires the master branch of the [CiviCRM WordPress plugin](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress) plus the custom WordPress.php hook file from the [CiviCRM Hook Tester repo on GitHub](https://github.com/christianwach/civicrm-wp-hook-tester) so that it overrides the built-in *CiviCRM* file.


== Installation ==

1. Extract the plugin archive 
1. Upload plugin files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
